# CS50

This repo host the solutions I have made up in order to complete the [CS50 course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)

## Remarks:

Coming from a bootcamp after working as an accountant, this course via the learning of the C language taught some basis 
I was lacking !

The course is very nice and entertaining.
